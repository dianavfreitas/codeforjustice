            <h1>Fostering Saves Lives</h1>
                <h2>Impact Of Fostering</h2>
                <p>The power of temporary homes is that fostering our animals is essential for finding them safe, loving homes outside of shelters. By opening your home to foster, you provide individualized care and support that significantly increases their chances of adoption. To put it into perspective, approximately 2.7 million animals are euthanized each year according to the (ASPCA) fostering can have an impact on rescuing more dogs and cats.</p>

                <h2>Sourcing Our Pets</h2>
                <p>Our foster pets come from local animal shelters, where they await their chance for a forever home. Owner surrenders also find refuge with us, as they face the possibility of going to the shelter if not taken in by a rescue.</p>
